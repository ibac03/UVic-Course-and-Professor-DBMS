1,So many slide decks and so much information it is so hard to decipher. Marks on petty items like the length of commit messages that is irrelevant in the industry. Seems out of touch with the modern software world.,"May 16th, 2024",5,1,SENG475,mdadams
2,Dr. Adams taught this course at a higher standard of quality than most others in the faculty. Seemed confident with material and spoke super clearly. Pretty low stress overall. Assignments were marked on completeness rather than correctness and there was no final; just 5 exams. Exam questions were just like assigned questions.,"Jan 16th, 2024",3,,ECE260,mdadams
3,"This class is VERY hard if you do not have self discipline. It is entirely self taught with lecture times being used as office hours instead of content. If you fall behind you will struggle to catch up. The material isn't easy, but it's not terrible, you just have to keep up. I fell about a month behind in the lecture videos, and never caught up.","Dec 21st, 2023",3,,ECE260,mdadams
4,"Simply put, I could not enjoy this course due to the professor. The grading was inconsistent in regard to marking schemes, and constantly fighting the grades consumed more of my time than I could spare. The professor does not know how the TAs mark the assignments and allows them to essentially mark however they like as long as it meets a target GPA","Aug 4th, 2023",4,1,ECE260,mdadams
5,"Dr Adams doesn't actually teach the class, instead sends you to YouTube videos to learn on your own. His class time is wasted doing practice problems already provided to you. He is doing the least amount of work possible to get a pay check. He makes you learn Matlab, you will need to learn it to pass this course.","May 7th, 2023",4,2,ECE260,mdadams
6,Lectures are just youtube videos. Assignments (worth at most 1% each) take up most of my work load every week. I cant say I learnt much and thats with an A in the course. There was no teaching that took place just a man saying look at this website I built but good luck trying to find any info on it. Interesting material but delivery was oh so bad.,"Nov 8th, 2022",4,2,ECE260,mdadams
7,"ECE 260's content has been incredible. However, Micheal Adams expects you to get through this course purely through self-study. The lectures are more akin to glorified office hours. Additionally, the workload is endless. Each week, you are either faced with 2 assignments that take up 8 hours each or a midterm worth 18% of your final grade.","Oct 28th, 2022",5,,ECE260,mdadams
8,"The async lecture videos didn't do much for me, but the great, free, and fully hyperlinked textbook was easy to study out of. Lots of information provided for assignment content and exam prep. Exam grading may feel more pedantic than you're used to, but at the end of the day you should only lose the marks you deserve to.","Aug 12th, 2022",4,,ECE260,mdadams
9,"ECE260 is a very very tough course but Dr. Adams is a pretty good prof. He's a big advocate for open and free textbooks and material which is great. But his tests are very hard and worth 90% which I can't say I'm a fan of. However, it's clear that Dr. Adams is a prof who wants to help the students who reach out. Get ready to learn. A lot.","Jul 24th, 2022",5,,ECE260,mdadams
10,This class is like taking lessons on how to drive in an automatic except the tests are done in a manual. The tests are also worth a cumulative 90%. Other wise a good prof.,"Jul 18th, 2022",4,2,ECE260,mdadams
11,"Michael is a very nice guy and genuinely cares about students' learning. His course material (text and video lectures) are all free to the public. ECE260 does not have easy content, but Michael does an amazing job of providing all the resources necessary to exceed in this course. Although he does tend to ramble a little during lecture.","Jun 17th, 2022",4,,ECE260,mdadams
12,Ok so here me out. Dr. Adams is definitely a character but I enjoyed ece 260. Wouldve like one less test but not having a final is way better than having a cumulative exam when the course covers a lot of new topics,"Dec 5th, 2021",4,,ELEC260,mdadams
13,"This dude makes me hate math. His assignments are exceptionally heavy, tests every two weeks and the tests do a poor job of matching what's given in the assignments. If you don't know how to use Matlab before taking this course, you're screwed because he will test you on it but won't teach it.","Oct 25th, 2021",5,1,ELEC260,mdadams
14,"The course material is very interesting and the course has a really good structure. Unfortunately, the teacher is ruthless and expects students to take on the most unrealistic workload I've ever seen. Insanely large assignments are due bi-weekly, and the teacher shows no compassion at all. He also leaves out important details in his assignments.","Jul 6th, 2021",5,1,SENG475,mdadams
15,"Overall, this was the most organized course I took compared to all my other online courses. Really enjoyed it! Michael's lectures were on youtube, so you could watch them anytime during the day. He made sure that the course was easy to navigate. He was willing to answer any questions during office hour in lecture time slots. Would def take again!","Dec 6th, 2020",4,,ECE260,mdadams
16,"With online classes, he simply doesn't make an effort to help his students with a very difficult class. Dr. Adams does the bare minimum.","Nov 14th, 2020",4,1,ECE260,mdadams
17,"If you can avoid this prof for online lectures, do. He literally gives you a youtube channel and tells you to watch the videos on your own time. He hates it when students email him because it takes up to much of his time. Basically, he's figured out how to do the least during online classes. Don't what I'm paying for in this class.","Nov 12th, 2020",4,1,ECE260,mdadams
18,"Took this class online due to Covid. Extremely useful and effective for learning robust C++. Lectures are prerecorded and publicly available on YouTube. He talks quickly, is thorough, well-organized, and cares for students' success. Expect to put in 16+ hours/week from week 1 to get an A+. I highly recommended the class if you can handle the work.","Aug 31st, 2020",5,,SENG475,mdadams
19,"I did online version of ECE 260 with him over the summer. Hardest thing I have had to do. Assignments are long and the tests are hard. He tried too hard to ensure academic integrity than trying to ensure if students actually learn. His youtube videos went like ""This equation integrated give this equation which gives us the next equation and so on""","Jul 29th, 2020",4,2,ELEC260,mdadams
20,"The assignments are extremely long and tedious, and they are marked on very picky details such as the way you write your Git commit messages. You have to read through pages of legalese to understand his specifications and rules. I came in super hyped to learn C++ and I learned a lot but everything was more frustrating than it had to be.","Jul 17th, 2020",5,,SENG475,mdadams
21,"His lecture was a bit confusing with a mix of many practice examples. He is caring and always accessible after the class. The midterm and final were similar to the previous year, but they were still challenging. The lab was straightforward and fair.","Jan 8th, 2024",4,,ECE360,panagath
22,Final was pretty difficult with many students only completing half of the questions. Midterm and the quizzes are were a bit hard. Some difficult concepts aren't well explained by Pan and you'd be better off looking online. Assignments are posted almost every week. Only good thing is Pan is lenient in his grading.,"Jan 4th, 2024",4,2,ECE360,panagath
23,"Lectures can be unclear and difficult to follow, with the few examples done using different notation then the text used. Assignments are time consuming and mostly unrelated to tested questions. Tests are fair for material covered in class.","Jul 6th, 2022",3,2,ECE460,panagath
24,Nice man. Based midterm on the previous years and suggests students to look at old exams as midterm/final are similar to them. Fair marking rubric on homework/quizzes and relevant examples are done in class.,"Dec 15th, 2019",4,,ECE360,panagath
25,"Explains concepts well, tested material is as expected from assignments etc. The posted lecture notes are a little out of order chronologically, but if you show up to class and do the assignments you'll know what is to be tested. Solves relevant problems on the chalkboard which is helpful.","Oct 26th, 2019",3,,ELEC360,panagath
26,"Great prof. The course content is somewhat heavy, showing up to class is a must.","Apr 11th, 2019",4,,ELEC460,panagath
27,"avoid at all cost, thank me later","Apr 9th, 2019",5,1,ECE460,panagath
28,"Agathoklis is a great professsor, ""isn't it?""","Dec 15th, 2016",3,,ELEC360,panagath
29,"Overall, a good professor. His midterm and final were very fair, and his review sessions are helpful. He provides good examples in class, and is pretty clear about what is and isn't testable. Do the homework, go to most classes, and you should do well. I don't care for the subject, but he made it slightly more bearable.","Dec 15th, 2016",3,,ELEC360,panagath
30,"Very, helpful in office hours. The course is difficult but if you actually do his homework and ask questions the class is very rewarding.","Dec 5th, 2016",3,,ELEC360,panagath
31,"Just shows up and reads slides from the textbook as fast as he can then goes home. Even if something is not clear or even incorrect he just powers on. What do you expect? This is electrical engineering at Uvic, you should be used to this by now.","Dec 5th, 2015",5,1.5,ELEC360,panagath
32,Awesome professor. Good guy all around. I enjoyed his class. Dr. Agathoklis motivated me to pursue mechatronics and controls engineering as a specialization and post graduate career.,"Jun 17th, 2015",3,,ELEC360,panagath
33,My advice to you is to take this course if you have studied 310 and 360. Just it will be fantastic.. Agathoklis is Knowledgeable prof. and kind in the same timed..Go ahead and take this course..,"May 9th, 2013",2,,A01,panagath
34,"Often assumes that students know things they may not(particularly if you are a software engineering student) which can make lectures confusing. This knowledge is not required for assignments and tests though. Overall, fairly effective","Apr 2nd, 2012",3,,ELEC360,panagath
35,"Great prof and great course. Really spurred my interest in controls. Make sure to attend class and pay close attention, what he actually says in class is golden.","Apr 16th, 2011",3,,ELEC460,panagath
36,Great prof! Very steady-steady guy!,"Jan 4th, 2011",4,,ELEC360,panagath
37,"Very nice prof. I like his course and him very much. Students won't have too much pressure on them. Shortcoming perhaps: not too well prepared for lectures and notes as other profs did. Though an disadvantage, I prefer somebody enjoying life.","May 29th, 2009",1,,ELEC532,panagath
38,"When I went into this class, i was expecting to learn a lot of practical and applicable stuff from the class. However, much emphasis was placed on the theory rather than its application. That made the course less interesting and hard as well. My grade speaks for itself. Wish I had not taken it.","May 4th, 2007",4,,ELEC483,panagath
39,THE best teacher I have ever had in my academic life. He deserved to be a candidate for 'Teaching Exellence' award or a Nobel prize in engineering.,"Nov 17th, 2005",2,,ELEC360AND460,panagath
40,"Very good prof. Gives useful, concrete examples, and derivations which are helpful but (usually) not too overly drawn-out. Exams can be tricky, but if you know the material, *study his examples* and look at practice exams, A+'s are possible.","Apr 25th, 2005",3,,ELEC360460,panagath
41,"Really a tough prof. Test questions are purposely trick. Her materials are some helpful, some frustrating. Good luck.","Jun 19th, 2024",5,1,519C,raltawy
42,"In my opinion this is a HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! Se has a very heavy accent so I could not follow his lecture, because of this I learn myself a lot of thing through Youtube. In the midterm I didnt solve the problems the way she taught/wanted and she discounted a lot of points! I don't recommend","Jun 11th, 2024",4,1,Cryptography,raltawy
43,"This was the hardest B I ever had. She is really lecture heavy and a lot of times her lecture's do not make much sense. Lectures are very boring, her accent is horrible, and completely honest it's the worst class i have taken at UVic. I don't mean to be rude but this is really a course that's not worth to be taken.","May 15th, 2024",5,1,519C,raltawy
44,this professor does nothing outside of class. She never got back a single assignment. She talks forever during class but doesn't matter much as her English is horrible. Assignments are really hard and only doable looking for templates or similar one on the internet. All in all hard prof and I didn't learn much..,"Apr 23rd, 2024",4,1,519C,raltawy
45,"Terrible, the class that i took was part online and part in class, but she took the online part as in she didn't have to teach at all! she expected you to learn everything by yourself. very difficult to understand what she says","Mar 13th, 2024",4,2,519C,raltawy
46,difficult to understand as English is not good and classes are not clear and midterm was way more difficult than the assignments almost nothing to do with them.,"Mar 6th, 2024",5,1,519C,raltawy
47,Classes just started and I notice this is a horrible professor!! She's mostly rude towards her students and never helps students understand anything whatsoever. Accent difficult to understand and sometines make fun of students. Let's see how exams will be.,"Feb 7th, 2024",4,1,519C,raltawy
48,unnecessary overcomplicated. the classes were very difficult and uninteresting. The grade consists of lists and heavy tests exclusively and the tests cover a broad range of topics with unpredictable levels of depth compared to the lists. My lowest grade for the last semester.,"Jan 3rd, 2024",3,1,519C,raltawy
49,"heavy exams. if you are prepared to study A LOT, then maybe you can do well as classes are almost useless and exams are far harder than what is taught in class.","Dec 13th, 2023",5,2,Cryptography,raltawy
50,"confusing classes, just a bunch of notes her handwriting is difficult to read. the exam was heavy much different from was taught in the online classes. terrible accent makes it hard to understand the content","Dec 9th, 2023",3,1,Blockchain,raltawy
51,Doesn't teach. hard to understand. Extremely hard theoretical exam.,"Nov 4th, 2023",5,2,Cryptography,raltawy
52,Just finished my course at UVIC this 2023 summer. Overall professors OK. Cryptography course is the only one I definitely wouldn't take again. Entered course with a reasonable gpa and practically failed the course. I was shockingly disappointedly with the professor to say it politely. Bad professor and you have to study A LOT and by yourself.,"Oct 31st, 2023",5,1,Cryptography,raltawy
53,"This class is absolutely terrible. Riham is very hard to understand, incredibly hard to follow and most of her explanations make no sense. I learned almost nothing in her classes. I mostly learned from Youtube videos, as most student in my class, even though it is hard cuz not all topics you can find videos about. Keep away if you can","Oct 25th, 2023",4,1,Cryptography,raltawy
54,"This professor was tough, it was difficult to pay attention to her classes as her accent is terrible. The lectures were bland and her voice is monotone. The homework is hard and the tests even harder. You learn by yourself. And her exams are heavy on math, prove theories, etc. nothing applicable.","Oct 18th, 2023",4,1,Blockchain,raltawy
55,at UVIc this was by far the worst class I've taken throughout my engineering course. Her tests are extremely hard and not related to what was taught in class. I almost failed the course and my average score went way down after it.,"Oct 10th, 2023",4,1,Cryptography,raltawy
56,I do not recommend this professor if you are trying to learn. She does not explain well and exams are heavy very different from what she teaches.,"Sep 30th, 2023",4,1,Cryptography,raltawy
57,"I regret taking this course, she is overly critical in how she grades and tests are far harder than what she teaches.","Sep 26th, 2023",5,2,Blockchain,raltawy
58,worst professor I had at UVIC. most students can't understand what she says terrible accent. tests are heavy with topics not explained in class,"Sep 15th, 2023",5,1,Cryptography,raltawy
59,"Made my final term awful. She makes the class much harder than it has to be, picking obscure points on the exams! Don't take this cryptography class unless you absolutely have to! She assigns tons of work, requires the a 30 year-old-book, is a hard grader, etc. Don't do it!","Sep 2nd, 2023",5,1,Cryptography,raltawy
60,This professor is not good. First exam was hard. Final exam was almost impossible. Homework era harshly and I only had one grade above an 75%. Classes were a waste of time as you can't understand what she says. The final exam covered things that were not covered in class or that was awfully explained.,"Aug 30th, 2023",4,1,Blockchain,raltawy
61,"Online lecture videos were just summaries of all the concepts, but were concise and easy to follow. Most of the class is done independently through reading the textbook building off of the lectures. Homework assignments are long and time consuming but there were only 3 before the midterms and were good practice. Midterms were challenging but fair.","Dec 16th, 2020",4,,ECE241,amiralib
62,Taking ECE 241 online for him. He recorded about 30 minutes of lectures a week where he talks about screenshots he took from the textbook then tells you to teach yourself the course. A disgusting lack of effort or care was put into this course.,"Nov 1st, 2020",4,1,ECE241,amiralib
63,Very good prof and great human being,"Mar 29th, 2018",1,,CENG450,amiralib
64,"Great prof! I took CENG 241 in 2015 with him. Don't miss his lectures, he's very good at explaining and breaking down course topics into pieces that are easier to understand.","Mar 6th, 2017",3,,CENG241,amiralib
65,One of the best profs at the school. He is passionate about computer architecture and it comes across in the ease with which he explains technical concepts. His quizzes are dead-easy if you attend lectures and yet you still come away with a good understanding of some of the fundamentals of computer architecture.,"Mar 27th, 2015",1,,CENG450,amiralib
66,"A real pleasure to hear this profs lectures. I look forward to them every day. He has awesome pace, and uses the perfect combination of powerpoint slides and writing on the board. I didn't particularly have an interest in computer engineering coming into the class, but he certainly changed that. Thanks for the awesome semester!","Jul 15th, 2013",1,,CENG241,amiralib
67,No Comments,"Aug 21st, 2007",4,2,CENG241,amiralib
68,"Amir is the BEST prof I have ever met. He's a rare gem in this cold world of engineering. The sincere passion that he radiates when he talks about the usually boring engineering material is what effected me the most. If all profs are one tenth as passionate about what they do -- research, teach, etc. -- more students would be inspired like I was.","Jul 18th, 2006",1,,CENG290241,amiralib
69,"This was a really tough course, but he did his best to make it easy and understandable. Smart guy.. obviously really understands the concepts thoroughly. Can answer pretty much any question thrown at him. Speaks directly to the class, and not into the chalkboard as so many other profs do.","Apr 12th, 2005",5,,CENG450,amiralib

77,"For ECE 458, was not an option. Very nice, understanding, and knowledgeable about the material. Genuinely interesting to listen to and wanted us to do well.

78,As Electrical Engineer backgournd. she has alot of energy. For students who want to pursue wireless communicaiton I recommend to take class. If you don't have engineering and mathematics backgournd the course is tough. She is inspiratioin to women in engineering.,"Jan 15th, 2023",4,,ELEC514,cai
79,The class was definitely hard but she's good with grading. I thought I'd fail but ended up getting an A- in class. She's good with concepts and her lectures might be heavy but they're fun. Do the assignments and you'll be good.,"Dec 28th, 2022",3,,ECE514,cai

94,This course felt like you needed a full knowledge in the subjects being taught before actually learning it. I can understand the importance of self study but this felt more like a speed run of the topics with little to no help in understanding it. The only time examples were given was the day right before the midterms which made it hard to study.,"Mar 26th, 2024",3,2,ECE471,capson
95,"Absolute legend. Lectures easy to follow, posts notes that give good summary of lecture if unable to attend. Implements a lab heavy course very well. Cares about his students and pops into labs sometimes. Textbook not mandatory, was referenced as extra material to study but not needed.","Dec 17th, 2023",2,,ECE241,capson
96,"I loved Capson, he's very clear and organized in his lectures. He structured and ran his course very well, things were very rarely left to interpretation. Tests were exactly what we expected and fair, no major surprises or tricks. Also amusing at times and gives a 5 min brain break in the middle of an hour-twenty lecture which is much appreciated.","Dec 13th, 2021",4,,ECE241,capson

99,"Probably the best class I've taken thus far, content wise as well as professor wise. David Capson really knows his stuff and has a way of teaching you EVERYTHING that you need to know just in lecture. The lab is really fun even though the manual is horrendous. Midterms and assignments were both fair however final was extremely long and only 2 hrs.","Dec 19th, 2016",2,,CENG241,capson
100,"Capson is one of the best professors I've ever had. He presented the material clearly with a great, subtle sense of humour, and usually ended class 15 - 30 minutes early. Assignments were uncommon and short, both midterms were easy but the final was quite hard and caught everyone off guard. The labs also required a lot of preparation.","Dec 11th, 2016",3,,CENG241,capson
101,"We had two relatively simple midterms which led me to believe that the final exam would be of the same level of difficulty; but maybe class average was too high so he wanted to bring it a little down. It was only 2 hours and calculations took forever. It would be totally fine if it were 3 hour-exam, but 2 isn't possible to complete it.","Dec 10th, 2016",5,1,CENG241,capson

Good luck!","Dec 14th, 2022",5,2,SENG350,jens

Does not make use of visuals or the board for any of the high level examples that he just talks about, which adds to the dryness of the class. Great group project. The readings, however, were unnecessary IMO as there was more than enough content on the slides.","May 1st, 2022",3,,SENG371,jens
486,Jens is a great professor but the material in the course is rather dry. Midterms are mass memorization with lots of material to memorize then are scaled since not a lot of people can memorize that much stuff.

He seems to be very generous with scaling though.","Dec 1st, 2021",3,,SENG360,jens

For the delivery of SENG360, I would have to rate him 3/5, since there was a clear disconnect between the lectures and the Assignments.

The labs in this class are pretty cool tho.","Dec 19th, 2018",2,,SENG360,jens

The course was laid out well, but some of the assignments were way too complex for an entry-level CSC course (I spent 25hrs on an assignment that was worth 5% of my grade).

I honestly learned so much from him, not only the material but how to break down and solve problems","Apr 18th, 2023",4,,CSC230,zastre
670,"not sure why zastre's ratings are so controversial, I thought he was a fantastic prof. Brings a great attitude to the classroom and has very detailed slides that he discusses. I was engaged in this class throughout the semester. Really enjoyed the system of asking questions thru the phone during class and overall would 100% reccomend","Apr 16th, 2023",3,,CSC230,zastre
671,Zastre is okay. I found his explanations were often more complex than they needed to be. His slides are too info dense and hard to follow. He does not give any study material for exams at all. This makes it difficult to test your own knowledge and to study for exams. He's knowledgeable but his teaching methods make this course pretty difficult,"Mar 28th, 2023",4,,CSC230,zastre
672,"Contrary to most people I talk to, I really enjoyed Dr. Zastre. He is witty and fun during lectures, and the depth of his knowledge on the subject really shows. His slides are dense, yes, but very well put together. I learned a lot from him and had a great experience in CSC230. I think the only thing that could use work is the exams","Mar 23rd, 2023",3,,CSC230,zastre
673,"Tough but fair. He's a harsh marker, but he makes his expectations very clear. If you eat shit in one of his courses (like me), you walk away knowing it was mostly your fault. The keys to success in a Zastre-taught course are paying attention during lecture, and doing the assignments.","Mar 14th, 2023",5,,SENG265,zastre
674,Zastre does so many small and annoying things that drive me crazy (please stop using ellipses I'm going to die...). His four assignments were all variations of the same program. He has no midterm study material besides his info-dense slides. And the assignments seemed very difficult for second year. The only good part was a clear grading criteria.,"Mar 7th, 2023",4,1,SENG265,zastre
675,The class was tough and the assignments took a very long time but I learned so much. I am thankful to have had Zastre as my prof for 265 because if you want to get through it you will have to become comfortable with the material. And because the assignments take so long you will become comfortable with the material.,"Jan 20th, 2023",5,,SENG265,zastre
676,"His lectures and slides are very long and information-dense, which makes them hard to go through, but they are loaded with useful information. The assignments are challenging because you have to impress him with your program, and two, it takes (A LOT) of time to code the solution. At first, the class is confusing, but after a while, it gets better.","Dec 30th, 2022",4,,SENG265,zastre
677,"Dr. Zastre is very knowledgeable and willing to help but can come off as condescending with his sarcastic attitude. His slides and lectures and very dense and can sometimes be hard to follow/understand. The assignments are very difficult, but you do learn a lot. There are no supplementary exercises/practice material so you go into midterms blind","Dec 30th, 2022",5,,CSC230,zastre
678,"He's a great prof! Assignments were great, midterms were a little challenging and the final was fair. Zastre's slides were the only aspect of this course that I didn't enjoy - they were overloaded with text, making it difficult to extract the crucial details. Don't feel bad if you made some stupid mistakes at the start, you'll still be fine!","Dec 21st, 2022",4,,CSC230,zastre
679,"Dr. Zastre is a great professor, who pushes you to do well. Assignments were tough and time-consuming, but I learned a LOT. Slides are extremely thorough and can seem confusing at first, but once you start to put the pieces together, are incredible and full of information. I enjoyed lectures and appreciated his sense of humor! 10/10","Dec 21st, 2022",4,,CSC230,zastre
680,"My favourite CSC course I've taken. Dr. Zastre is knowledgeable and charismatic, and his lecture slides are dense but clear. Assignments are very difficult yet oddly satisfying. I believe his ratings are low because his sarcasm can come across as condescending, but I don't feel this is his intent. Unfortunately, he does not provide practice tests.","Dec 17th, 2022",4,,CSC230,zastre
